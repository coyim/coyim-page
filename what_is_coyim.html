    <p>CoyIM is a standalone chat client that focuses on safety and security. It is a self-contained program that runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. CoyIM only supports one chat protocol - XMPP (sometimes known as Jabber). CoyIM has carefully picked and chosen the features that are necessary to create a good chat experience, while keeping the attack surface of the system to a minimum.</p>
    <p>It also has built-in support for Tor, OTR and TLS. The Tor support allows users to become anonymous while chatting, OTR makes end-to-end encryption of communication possible, and TLS adds another layer of encryption for the communication with chat servers. These features are not plugins or extras in any way.</p>
    <p>CoyIM is implemented in Go. Many other implementation languages open up the door for a large number of attacks; we try to minimize those risks by using Go.</p>

  <h2>Features that set us apart</h2>
  <p>CoyIM implements lots of features that exist in most other chat clients. There are, however, some things we do differently:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support of the latest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging" target="_blank" title="OTR Protocol">OTR</a>. </li>
    <li>Detection of Tor (if installed) and connection through it.</li>
    <li>Use of Tor Onion Service if it is known by the server in question.</li>
    <li>Use of separate Tor circuits for each account in order to make it harder to tie accounts together.</li>
    <li>Insertion of random delays before connecting to each account in order to make fingerprinting of connections between accounts harder.</li>
    <li>SRV lookup for the server over Tor if available.</li>
    <li>Import of account settings, OTR settings, fingerprints, and private keys from other clients like Pidgin, Adium, Gajim or xmpp-client.</li>
    <li>Saving of all your configuration, including OTR fingerprints and keys, in an encrypted configuration file.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Features we want to have</h2>
  <p>CoyIM wants to add some more features. These are the most important ones but there are many more we want to have (check them at <a href="https://github.com/coyim/coyim/issues" target="_blank" title="Github Issues">Github issue tracker</a>):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Availability in different languages.</li>
    <li>Creation of a new anonymous random account with one single option.</li>
    <li>Support of complete reproducible builds.</li>
    <li>Use of a unified security rating that combines several different measures of security.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Features we won't have</h2>
  <p>Features have a tendency to result in a larger code base and bugs. For this reason, we will not support some features, like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use of browser view to render content inside CoyIM or rendering of HTML.</li>
    <li>Use of clickable links.</li>
    <li>Use of emoticons or other kinds of extra graphical feature.</li>
    <li>Exposition of configuration options.</li>
    <li>Use of logging.</li>
  </ul>
