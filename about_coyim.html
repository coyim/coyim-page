<p>CoyIM is a standalone chat client with a focus on safety and security. It is a self contained program that runs on Windows, Linux and OS X. CoyIM only supports one chat protocol - XMPP (which is sometimes known as Jabber). The goal of CoyIM is not to have every feature under the sun. Instead we want to carefully pick and choose the features that are necessary to create a good chat experience, while keeping the attack surface of the system to a minimum.</p>

<p>In addition to choosing features carefully, we have also built in support for Tor, OTR and TLS. The Tor support allows users to become anonymous when chatting. OTR makes end-to-end encryption of communication possible. And TLS adds another layer of encryption to the communication with the chat servers. We have built these features to be core parts of the application - they are not plugins or extras in any way.</p>

<p>CoyIM is implemented in Go. We made this choice to make it easier to protect our users. Many other implementation languages open up the door for a large number of attacks. We try to minimize those risks by using Go.</p>
